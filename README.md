# Budget Tracker App

### **Thought Process**
- **Frontend:** Used **React (Vite)** for its fast performance and easy state management.
- **UI:** Used **Bootstrap** for a simple and responsive design.
- **State Management:** Used `useState()` for managing expenses, categories, and filters.
- **Data Persistence:** Stored expenses in **local storage** so they remain even after refresh.
- **Charts:** Used **Recharts** to display expenses in a graphical format.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Netlify** for easy access.
